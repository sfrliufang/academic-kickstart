Our reserach aims to develop scalable and controllable processes to produce low dimensional materials and their artificial structures, and unravel their static and dynamical electronic, magnetic and photonic properties to provide novel platforms for next-generation information processing, light processing, and quantum devices. Our interests include:
- Two dimensional materials
- Optical and photoemission spectroscopy
- Material and physical chemistry
